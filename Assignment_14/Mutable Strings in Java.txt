                                   Mutable Strings in Java


Q.1 What is a Mutable String in Java Explain with an example ?
→Once if we create a String, on that String if we try to perform any operation and if those changes get reflected in the same object then such strings are called “Mutable String”.

* Example: StringBuffer, StringBuilder

1.StringBuffer(1.0v)
* If the content will change frequently then it is not recommended to go for String object becoz for every new change a new Object will be created.
* To handle this type of requirement, we have a StringBuffer / StringBuilder concept.
* StringBuffer sb=new StringBuffer();
Creates an empty StringBuffer object with default initial capacity of "16".
* Once StringBuffer reaches its maximum capacity a new StringBuffer Object will be created. 

* new capacity = (current capacity+1) * 2;

Example : 
	StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(); 
	System.out.println(sb.capacity()); //16 
	sb.append("abcdefghijklmnop");
 	System.out.println(sb.capacity()); //16 
	sb.append('q'); 
	System.out.println(sb.capacity()); //34

1.StringBuilder(1.5v)
   * StringBuilder is the same as StringBuffer(1.0V) with few differences.

   * StringBuilder : 
   * - No methods are synchronized.
   * - At a time more than one thread can operate so it is not ThreadSafe.
   * - Threads are not required to wait so performance is high.
   * - Introduced in jdk1.5 version
