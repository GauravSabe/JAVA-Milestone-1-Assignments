Operators and Loops

 1.What are the Conditional Operators in Java ?
→They are used when a condition comprises more than one boolean expression. 
For instance, if we want to print a number only if it is greater than 2 and less than 5, then we will use conditional operators to combine the 2 expressions. 
* We have 3 types of conditional operators : 
1.  Logical-and (&&)
2.  Logical-or (||)
3. ternary operator (?:)


 2.What are the types of operators based on the number of operands ?
→Operators in Java can be categorised based on two criteria : 
* Number of operands :– There are three types of operators based on the number of operands. 
* An operator is called a unary, binary, or ternary operator based on the number of operands.
        
 3.What is the use of Switch case in Java programming ?
→Let’s say we have a variable. Now, we want to do multiple operations on it based upon what value it is storing. In such cases the switch statement comes into play.
* The switch case in java is used to select one of many code blocks for execution. 


 4.What are the priority levels of arithmetic operation in Java ?
→Java Arithmetic Operators follow the order of operations as we do normally in Mathematics, that order being 
* Parentheses : ()
* Exponents or Power
* Multiplication : *
* Division (from left to right) : /
* Addition : +
* Subtraction (from left to right) : -


 5.What are the conditional Statements and use of conditional statements in Java ?
→Conditional statements in Java are used to make decisions based on certain conditions. 
* The most common conditional statements in Java are the If-Else statement, the Switch statement, and the Ternary Operator. 
* These statements allow the program to execute different blocks of code based on specific conditions.


 6.What is the syntax of if-else statement ?
→if(condition)
{
                //Statements;
}
else
{
//Statements;
}


 7.What are the 3 types of iterative statements in java ?
→ Three types of loops are : 
1. while loop :- Repeats a set of statements while a given condition is true.
2. for loop :- Executes a set of statements a fixed number of times.
3. do while loop :- Repeats a set of statements at least once and then continues to repeat as long as a given condition is true.
 

 8.Write the difference between for loop and do-while loop ? 
→ 1.for loop :- Executes a set of statements a fixed number of times.
* Syntax : for( initial - statement; condition; final - statement )
     {
//Statements;
      }
2.do while loop :- Repeats a set of statements at least once and then continues to repeat as long as a given condition is true.
* Syntax : initial - statement;
             do
              {
                //statements;
                final - statement;
       }while(condition);
