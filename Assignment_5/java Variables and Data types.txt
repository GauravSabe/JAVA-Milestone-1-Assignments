Java Variables and Data  types

 1.What is statically typed and dynamically typed Programming      Language ?
→ Statically typed :-  if the memory of the variable is given during the compilation time itself then such types of programming languages are called as “Statically typed”.
Eg :- C , C++ , Java , etc.
Dynamically typed :- if the memory of the variable is given during the execution time itself then such types of programming languages are called as “dynamically typed”.
Eg :- Python , PHP , JavaScript , etc.


 2.What is the variable in java? 
→ DataType variable_name = value;
* The variable_name is the name of a variable. We can initialise the variable by specifying an equal sign and a value (initialization i.e. assigning an initial value, is optional). However, the compiler never assigns a default value to an uninitialised local variable in Java.
* It is used to store value.
Ex :- int age = 20;
Int → DataType
Age → variable_name 
20 → value
* Variables can be declared and assigned separately. 
* Example :-
int rate; 
rate = 40;


 3.How To Assign a Value To Variable. 
→The first time a variable is assigned a value, it is said to be initialised.                     The = symbol is known as the assignment operator. It is also possible to declare a variable and assign it a value in the same line, so instead of int i and then i = 9 you can write int i = 9 all in one go.


 4.What are Primitive data types in java?
→A primitive type is predefined by the language and is named by a reserved keyword.
Primitive Data Types :
1. byte
2. short
3. int
4. long
5. float
6. double
7. char
8. boolean


 5.What are the identifiers in java?
→ An identifier is a name given to a package, class, interface, method, or variable. All identifiers must have different names.
In Java, there are a few points to remember while dealing with identifiers :
Rule 1 − All identifiers should begin with a letter (A to Z or a to z), $ and _ and must be unique.
Rule 2 − After the first character/letter, identifiers can have any combination of characters.
Rule 3 − A keyword cannot be used as an identifier.
Rule 4 − The identifiers are case-sensitive.
Rule 5 - Whitespaces are not permitted.
Examples of legal identifiers : rank, $name, _rate, __2_mark. 
Examples of illegal identifiers : 102pqr, -name.
These variables, identifiers etc. consume memory units. Before proceeding ahead, let us have a look at the memory unit concept too. Here, we will only focus on the relevant concept of memory.




 6.List the Operators in java.
Operators in Java can be classified into 6 types : 
1. Arithmetic Operator
2. Relational Operator
3. Logical Operator
4. Assignment Operator
5. Unary Operator
6. Bitwise Operators


 7.Explain about increment and decrement operators and give an examples.
→ Increment and Decrement Operators :  
PreIncrement(++a) → first add value then display
                PostIncrement(a++)  → first display value then add
PreDecrement(--a) → first sub value then display
PostDecrement(a--) → first display value then sub
- Example :- 
class Main 
{
public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
int a = 5, int b = 6;
 int c = a++;//post increment
 int d = ++a;//pre increment
 int e = b—-;//post decrement
int f = –b;// pre decrement
System.out.println(c);
System.out.println(d);
System.out.println(e);
System.out.println(f);
                      }
}
