              Arrays in Java
1.What is the default value of Array for different data types ? 
 → int , double = 0
* boolean = false 
* String = null


2.Can you pass the negative number in Array size.
→Array dimensions cannot have a negative size.


3.Where does Array stored in JVM memory ?
→The reference types in Java are stored in heap area. Since arrays are reference types (we can create them using the new keyword) these are also stored in heap area.


4.What are the disadvantages of Array ?
→Fixed-size : The size of an array is fixed. Once the size is declared, it cannot be changed. ...
* Lack of flexibility :  Arrays are not very flexible as they have a fixed size. ...
* Overhead :  When working with arrays, an overhead is involved in terms of time and memory.


5.What is an Anonymous Array in Java ? Give an example ?
→An array in Java without any name is known as an anonymous array.
* It is an array just for creating and using instantly.
*  Using an anonymous array, we can pass an array with user values without the referenced variable
Example : 
class calc1
{
public int add1(int nums[])
{
int result = 0;
for(int n:nums)
{
    result = result + n;
}
return result;
}  
}
public class Anonymous_Array {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    calc1 obj1 = new calc1(); 
    int nums[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}; 
    int sum1 = obj1.add1(nums);  //Anonymous_Array 
    System.out.println(sum1); 
    }
}
// output : 45
6.What are the different ways to traverse an Array in java ?
→To traverse through an array you can use a loop. For loop or while loop or do while loop. To traverse through an array and keep track of the highest value you can maintain a variable and update it after each iteration if a value larger than that is encountered.


7.What is the difference between length and length() method Give an Examples ?
→length
- It is a property of the Array type class.
* length()
- It is a method of String class.
Example :
int[] a= {10,20,30};
System.out.println(a.length); //3
String[] names={"sachin","saurav","dhoni","yuvi"};
System.out.println(names.length); //4
System.out.println(names[0].length()); //6
